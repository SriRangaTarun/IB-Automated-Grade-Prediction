# IB-Automated-Grade-Prediction
A recurrent neural network algorithm (LSTM) that automatically assigns predicted grades to students based on their overall performance in tests
throughout the academic year. 

Note : In the future, I plan to also consider the participation of the student in class (answering
questions, asking good questions etc) while giving predicted grades.
